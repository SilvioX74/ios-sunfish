# Plan (2026-11-02): hardware video decode, apps and games

Rules: CLAUDE.md ("How to work"). Old plan: `docs/plans/2026-11-02-speed-and-heat.md`. One line per item;
details and history in the feature Logs (`docs/features/<name>.md`).

## Focus (the user, 2026-11-02)
Make more things work: video in apps like Instagram first (hardware decode), then games and App Store apps.
Interface speed and heat are good enough for daily use (Settings ~57 swaps/s, Control Center 43.8, peaks ~82 C);
the speed focus is over. Targets (Claude's numbers, the user can change them):
- Video: a 1080p H.264 video plays smoothly in Safari with hardware decode, CPU under 15 % of one core.
- 3D: a WebGL game in Safari runs 15 min without a GPU hang.
- Apps: one free App Store app installs and runs (gate for Instagram, Crossy Road, Minecraft).
- Stability: under 1 GPU hang per hour of soak.

## Test schedule
- Normal test runs: 15 min at most. A/B comparisons: 5 boots per side (tools/sunfish-perfab.sh).
- One 1 h soak per night, after `work/night` is set (9:30 pm or when the user says); results in [gpu-bugs.md](gpu-bugs.md).
- A run with a hang, a backboardd restart, the panel off or 0 swaps is void.
- Stop rule: a gain under 1 ms counts only if a 5-boot A/B confirms it.

## Priority (a couple at a time, dev speed on top; ▶ = being worked; ~half a day max each, except stage work of item 1)
Only items Claude can move now. User tasks are listed below and never gate work; parked ones in docs/backlog.md.
1. ▶ **Hardware video decode** (Snapdragon 730G video engine, "Venus"), in stages, each a go/no-go (video.md):
   0. Done 2026-11-03: all 4 clips play in software, 250-590 % of one core, max 64 C (video.md s0).
   1. Done 2026-11-02: research, staged spec in video.md (PAS ID 9, HFI gen1, plugin slot ExampleIPB.videodecoder).
   2. Bring-up with `venusctl`: firmware boots and answers SYS_INIT 2026-11-03 (v2b); left: clean teardown, session round trip.
   3. First frame: a phone tool decodes a raw H.264 file to a YUV buffer, checked against a reference.
   4. VideoToolbox decoder plugin: Safari/AVPlayer play through it; H.264, then HEVC.
   5. Tuning: heat, 4K, several streams at once (feeds).
2. **3D test**: WebGL in Safari, 15 min. Blocked by B55 (context lost at creation, 2026-11-03): fix that first.
3. **App Store access**: can it sign in and install a free app? Gate for Instagram and games (1-2 h).
4. **GPU stability**: G1 (no recovery) and G4 (backboardd restart); nightly soak; fix whichever rises (gpu.md).
5. **Garbled and undrawn images** (B44, B53): Notes attachments, Safari tab thumbnails, Music icon, Maps glitch.

After these: small Metal test apps built here (textured cube with depth, compute), then Crossy Road (Unity), Instagram,
Minecraft. Likely needed on the way: YUV surfaces in the bridge (G7 "planar iosurface refused"), louder speaker (B16),
a GPU stand-in for the missing colour-convert/scale hardware (helps Photos too; cpu.md phs).

## GPU bugs
Listed with exact log lines and rates in [gpu-bugs.md](gpu-bugs.md) (not auto-loaded). Fix one when it voids tests,
stops phone work, or doubles in rate after a change (then turn that change off first).

## Phone
Claude's. Up since the n8 soak boot (2026-11-02 21:31, kernel158 everyday), idle, slider at minimum.
Everyday setup: kernel158 (sweetgpufreq=6, sweethwcg=1, sweetsmmutcr=3, sweetfencepoll=200, sweetvsyncphase=5000, A76
1939 MHz compiled in) sweetse9=2 sweetcampmic=2 sweetswapbig=6 sweetampreset=1; bundle work/metal2-next 82f6b41
(SweetMetal2 4C4C44A9); backboardd env CA_DISABLE_LUMA_BOOST=1 CA_FORCE_TIMER=1; /var/local/mtl2-env = SWEET_U0011..14=1,
TU_FETCH_GMEM_MIN_DRAWS=20, SWEET_SURF_FLUSH=1, SWEET_CULL=3 (tools/sunfish-install-speed.sh). Everyday boot: `tools/sunfish-test.sh -k 158 TAG sweetse9=2 sweetcampmic=2 sweetswapbig=6 sweetampreset=1`.

## Next (in this order)
1. Done 2026-11-03 (s0, video.md): Safari plays all 4 clips in software, 250-590 % CPU, 1080p H.264 drops 5.6 %.
   WebGL context is lost at creation (B55): investigator running; the 3D test waits on it.
2. Stage 2: firmware boots, SYS_INIT_DONE (v2b). Implementer: teardown fix + `session` step; then builder, then
   `tools/sunfish-venus-test.sh session` on the phone.
3. Bridge 0125 SWEET_M2V_PASS_CACHE (50adec5, VkRenderPass cache, ~0.25 ms): rebuilt 2026-11-02 21:54
   (METAL2_VARIANT=next, LC_UUID 4C4C444C-...-BBFD7B88C1E1, not installed), then a 5-boot A/B on settings, cc, home.
4. Tonight: night soak n9 (`tools/sunfish-nightsoak.sh n9`; it sets work/night at 21:30).

## User tasks (details in user-tasks.md; nothing waits on these)
proximity by hand (U17), battery discharge (U3), headphone plug test (U15), Files check (U13), touch while plugged in (U14).
Parked for later (the user, 2026-10-30): Compass accuracy, camera far focus, auto-brightness (B42), headphone jack iOS side.
Back in play now the speed focus is over: speaker volume (B16), garbled images (B44), stale clock (B49), battery + camera
CPU (O14), camera polish (B48).
Finished items: [completed.md](completed.md) (not auto-loaded).

## Upstream (the daily check adds here; details in backlog.md)
- Touch poll under 8 ms while touched (hakios-xnu 6d8f818; ~3.5 ms input lag, guess; needs a latency tool).
- RPMh try-lock: retry on EBUSY, a vote can fail silently now (0.5 h; found reading ours for e5b01a0).
- xpcproxy identity version (hakios-xnu 78b518b): first count the errors in one Safari oslog.
- Privilege table (hakios-xnu 502aee8, 2 h): may wake daemons quieted for heat, watch idle CPU.
- Speaker guard for louder sound (315e973, 3-5 h), iOS microphone (2bb073e, 1-2 days, B23 risk): with B16.
- Driver review reports (230762c, 5429d38, 1800069; 2-3 h read-only): SMEM padding underflow found in phone/wifi/smem.c.

## Questions for you (Claude took the recommended path meanwhile)
- PowerLog and CoreDuet databases on the phone were moved aside (not deleted) to /var/local/idlefix-db, to stop the idle
  CPU burn; `tools/sunfish-idlefix-db.sh --undo` restores them. OK to delete them later? (Kept for now.)

## Your tasks at the phone
In [user-tasks.md](user-tasks.md) (not auto-loaded): 11 open. Claude doesn't wait on them; it moves to the next item.

## Dev speed (on top of the priority list when found; ~1 h max each)
- (none)

## Backlog
The Broken, Later and Optimize lists are in [backlog.md](backlog.md) (not auto-loaded); leftover speed items in Optimize.

## Verification
Each item: numbers in the feature Log, this plan and the README status table in the same commit, a journal line,
a webcam check for anything visible, battery ≥ 3600 mV before each boot.
